We are going to deploy a keycloak development server on a virtual machine. This article is based on [Johannes Reppin's](https://gitlab.desy.de/johannes.reppin/keycloak-docker-compose) implementation. The basic steps are all mentioned in the README file of this repository. However, a few key steps are worth mentioning.

Our identity server has been deployed to a virtual machine that has been hosted in GCP. For your subdomain you just need to create an `A` type record in your DNS settings that point the subdomain to the external IP of the virtual machine. Thats's it!

The initial steps are all in the [Blog](https://gitlab.desy.de/johannes.reppin/keycloak-docker-compose) and [this Plural Sight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/keycloak-getting-started/table-of-contents) course. Once you have completed the steps, clone the repo, navigate to the repository dir on your machine and run the following commands

The interesting part about this installation is the `nginxproxy/acme-companion` image. This couples very nice with the base nginx image `nginxproxy/nginx-proxy` image as it issues an ssl certificate for you from let-encrypt.

```bash
$ docker compose pull
$ docker compose up -d
```

and Voil√†! Your very own identity server is up and running. Don't you just love open-source!
