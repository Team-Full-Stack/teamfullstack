Please review the post `Configuring ssh on linux` in order to be able to follow along. This way you will have access to an ssh server.

## Some useful commands
Lets generate some handy shell scripts that can be reused across the terminal (from any directory). Be sure to move the shell scripts to `/usr/local/bin`.

```
.
├── cat_remote.sh
├── download_remote.sh
├── list_remote.sh
└── upload_remote.sh
```

### cat_remote.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_private_key root@ip_or_host cat "$1"
```

sample usage: `cat_remote.sh /root/envs.txt`
This command simply prints the contents of the remote file `/root/envs.txt`

### download_remote.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash
scp -i ~/.ssh/id_private_key root@ip_or_host:"$1" "$2"
```

sample usage: `download_remote.sh /root/envs.txt ~/Desktop/envs1.txt`
This command downloads the remote file `/root/envs.txt` to `~/Desktop/envs1.txt`

### list_remote.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_private_key root@ip_or_host ls -la "$1"
```

sample usage: `list_remote.sh /root`
This command list the contents of the remote directory `/root`

### upload_remote.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash
scp -i ~/.ssh/id_private_key "$1" root@ip_or_host:"$2"
```

sample usage: `upload_remote.sh ~/Downloads/envs.txt /root`
This command copies the file `~/Downloads/envs.txt` to remote folder `/root`
